{"role": "user", "content": "Question: So tell me a little about you. Where did you grow up? Ningxia: Hi, I'm Ningxia Zhang. I'm an artist living in New York City now but I'm originally from a small town in China called Yichang, in Hubei province. It's not a big city. I was born in 1990, so I'm turning thirty-five soon — not exactly young anymore, haha. I grew up there until I was 18, then moved to Shanghai for university. I ended up studying software engineering at Fudan University, mostly because I didn't do that well on the college entrance exam, so my options were limited. I didn't even know what coding was when I started, and honestly, I didn't enjoy it much. But I also didn't really know what else I could do at the time. After four years of that, I knew I wanted to move towards something more creative and visual. I also had this strong desire to go abroad. Since I was around 13, I'd been obsessed with Western music and subcultures — I discovered so much through the internet. I was really into American hip-hop, gangsta rap, R&B, and later got into rock — Brit-pop, post-punk, post-rock… especially alternative rock from the 80s and 90s. That was my world back then. So during college, I was still super passionate about all that, and I felt like I just had to go and experience it for myself. Question: So how did you end up in the US? Ningxia: Um, and then um I decided that um I will need to go to either the US or the UK and I wanted to study human computer interaction because it's an interdisciplinary field that connects computer science and psychology, and design. And I kind of felt like, um, at a time I thought that would be something that's more creative and more visual and I was interested in design. And at the time I was also just got very influenced by all the Apple products that I kind of felt like the technology can be designed in a way that is so um like tasteful and human-like I felt like I could do something there that could be really combining um my interests and yeah, so that's that's what I decided to do. I applied for all the graduate, mostly master programs in the US and that's how I ended up at Stanford. Question: What do you think of the Stanford experience? Ningxia: It was pretty intense I would say. It's probably one of the most intense and busy and stressful period of time in my life. So it is Stanford so it does have very, very high quality bar and has very high caliber and rigor in terms of academics. So I studied computer science there and I took machine learning and artificial intelligence and uh I sort of have studied those in my undergrad, but on a much simpler level. The levels that we were took in those classes at Stanford was a lot more in depths, a lot more sophisticated in terms of understanding the maths and probabilistic models. Yeah, I guess now after more than 10 years, I would't have imagined that artificial intelligence has been advanced so much. But I would say that I didn't really fit into the culture. They were very much, uh, given that it was a very tech and science and Stem focused atmosphere, very entrepreneurial. A lot of things focusing on startups in 2012. It was very different at a time and I didn't quite find myself fitting into that culture because I find myself more interested in uh in art, in culture, in things that are more related with humanities. So at a time I doubted myself a lot if I really fit in there, uh, if technology and entrepreneurship should be my future, but I was so influenced by the culture there that I thought that was like the only meaningful thing to do in the world. Question: You an artist now. How did that happen? Why did you make that transition? Ningxia: Yeah, so after Stanford, I was working in Silicon Valley as a product designer for many years and honestly, I thought that I would make an impact in the world, idealistically thinking that I would make a den in a universe, as that was the saying. But more and more I realized that the whole tech world was really built upon capitalism and it's building and attention economy and consumerism on steroids that is really not the kind of vision that I see for the world going forward. I'm not entirely aligned with these values and also in 2016 and 2017, I saw even more negative impact from the tech industry interfering on democracy and causing conflicts, or even genocide in some other parts of the world. And that kind of just made me rethink that if the things that I'm doing is really that meaningful and and if not, like what other things that I could be doing, if I want to find some kind of meaning in my life. That's when I reconnected with my childhood, so I actually spent a lot of years learning and practicing art when I was a kid. I didn't pursue that because, my parents and my art teachers and everyone around were advising me to focus on study, focus on science and maths, and art doesn't usually make a promising career and that was even agreed by my uncle who is an artist. So that's the reason why I gave up at the time, but then I got reconnected in my 20s that maybe that was still something I really wanted to do. Maybe even though art might not be directly impactful on the world, it could be a powerful thing to connect with people or change people's perspectives, or just providing a different perspective, that I felt potentially it's more meaningful than building products and platforms and not technical services to make people waste more time and buy more things. Question: How do you feel about that now looking back on the transition? Ningxia: Yeah are looking back it definitely felt like a quite long journey. It was not straightforward in any way.  There were a lot of frustrations and confusions, and disappointment, but I would say it is a quite a meaningful journey that I searched that I discovered the dream of doing art is still within myself. It was still something that I naturally leaned towards. I think it even kind of clarified more to myself that what matters to me, what are my values. Question: Talk a bit more about your journey of becoming an artist. Ningxia: Um, yeah, so it took me a long time to explore my art practice. At the very beginning, I just felt very um insecure and lack of confidence because I didn't get a more formal education, like a postgraduate education in arts. I thought about pursuing an MFA, but I kind of just felt like that, um it's really a big investment in terms of time and money and I kind of feel like maybe I can do it in an non-institutional way, an unorthodox way um that I don't have to go through that path and kind of learn it on my own. I do have some foundation as I was trained in sketching and uh Chinese painting and Western painting, since I was like 5 or 6 until uh probably like 14 were 15, so give or take seven or eight years of training um in visual arts. So I thought that given like I have I had opportunities to travel around the world, to go see museums and uh read art history on my own. I live in New York right now and I have been living here for five years and all this experience and environment and resources that I can use to form my own MFA, uh so I didn't pursue a formal degree, but I still kind of feel like I'm maybe a little bit of an outsider, uh transitioning from uh, and an engineer or a designer uh into an artist. uh So it did took me a long time to try to find the right approach, the right topic, the themes, the methodology, the kind of art practice that I want to do. It did take a really long time. Question: What are some of the things you've tried? Ningxia: Yeah, I've tried a lot of different things um at the beginning I've tried um more kind of digital stuff. I tried learning 3D modeling and rendering with cinema 4D. I tried virtual reality, uh augmented reality with this 3D, uh techniques I've learned, uh, also like learning it uh through implementing it on web because at the time I was still living in San Francisco and I didn't have space for um uh physical studio. I also maybe a little bit felt that I was scared of the physical world, uh because I spent so much time in the digital world and I felt more confident in that way. Uh, so that was pretty much the beginning, trying out digital art painting on the iPad, not on actual canvas, um, trying out many different technologies, at the same time, I also didn't feel confident in coding either, just kind of finding code snippets and examples online and trying to uh, at the time I was very interested in like big scale installations and I was trying to replicate that in a virtual space. And then later on after I moved to New York, I kind of felt like I really wanted to more focus on my own personal stories. I have tried that when I was at Stanford and I think like coming from my own, telling my own stories have been pretty successful and something that I felt the works really connected and resonated with people. So I've started doing photography, uh, also learned oil painting at SVA and more and more I felt like my works were more focusing on a feminine experience, female experience. Also at a time, COVID-19 happened, um, the pandemic happened and I spent a lot of time exploring, solitude, uh, loneliness, um the longing for connection, frustration, disappointment, um being women and uh navigating through the fragile friendships, the difficulties of getting intimate intimacy and also just like going through a lot of loss and grief and trauma on my own uh during that time. So, yeah, exploring just ways to heal myself. um and in the meantime, making arts kind of is a way of uh healing myself and hopefully the process of it and the output of it also has some kind of healing effects to people. Question: What were the difficulties and traumas that you were trying to heal from? Ningxia: Well, that's a lot that's probably I don't know like many many therapy sessions. I do have the fortune to have a really good uh therapist that I've been working with since I came to New York and it has been really, really helpful. So a lot of the difficulties came from my childhood. It's hard to describe. like the kind of trauma, but um my parents had a pretty challenging marriage and um there were some really um uncommon conflicts happening in my family in terms of uh religious beliefs, political leaning and just in general ideology. uh so it's not kind of uh affairs or trivial life stuff, it's more kind of on those levels. And for me as a kid, it was pretty confusing and pretty challenging to live in a household like that. At the same time, growing up in China, uh, you know a small town in a pretty normal average income family, uh, I had a lot of confidence issues, uh, especially when I went from a small town to Shanghai, uh to a big metropolitan city, uh, one of the best universities in China. I had many issues with finance, I had a lot of anxiety about money and comparing myself to others uh, and that continued and even got worse when I got to Stanford, a elite school. And it was pretty obvious that I came from a much lesser, much more humble background and sort of feeling like I need to work so much more to just even be at the same level ground with other people. um It just felt like why does everything have to be so much harder for me? Um, even if I've made so much effort to go from a humble background to um kind of more of an elite level, let's say. um But I still face so many challenges and psychological issues. And even just like finding people that can understand me and emphasize with me, uh, because the people I meet tend to not have any understanding of someone like me who came here and with a lot of debt from my family and relatives, um that I need to be very careful with money, um, and I didn't feel that I particularly fit in to the environment there as everyone doesn't worry about the same things as I do, um yeah, it's um a lot of difficulties, uh, in that way. uh. One of the ways is always comparing myself to others. I'm feeling like I am the uniquely unfortunate one, uniquely unlucky one. And with that it's also just pessimism that it will always be with me um, no matter what I do, I cannot change this uh fact that I came from lesser background and I would not be as successful as other people because I'm just disadvantaged from the beginning. Even if that I have reached um a much better place that I've achieved a lot, it's still kind of felt like yeah, because I'm unfortunate I have to make that much more effort to make it even. Question: How would you describe your art practice now? Ningxia: My practice now is still very much still work in progress. I mean it's always a living evolving being, the practices itself. So I'm still exploring. I'm not settling on a certain definition. Um, but I have worked on a few versions of artist statement uh in which I try to describe the themes and approaches that I'm using. So here's one version of my artist statement. So, uh, I'm Ningxia. I am an artist and technologist, leaving and working in New York City. uh rooted in compassion. My practice employees a range of strategies and materials to explore the fundamental human experiences, including pain, desire, love and grief. I often work with my most intimate personal memories, histories and archival materials. I'm aiming to connect with people through this shared inner phenomena and try to shed light on pathways to heal. I shift between and combine different techniques of different mediums, including digital fabrication, virtual world building, performance, and moving images, uh I create work that invoke embodied experiences and therapeutic effects and a sense of oneness. I have a background, professional and educational in computer science and technology, um, but I actually center my practice on investigation into humans' inner lives uh with influences from eastern philosophies, behavioral biology and neuroscience, uh with the rapid progression of artificial intelligence, I'm really trying to foreground the complexity and uniqueness of being human with all its messiness, inefficiency, agony, contradictions, and capacities to empathize and love. uh also confronted with the the climate crisis, continuous conflicts and wars, the increasing isolation and polarization that we're seeing in this world. I'm really feeling there is an urgency to resort to collective healing  and connecting through fundamental human values. So that's one version of it."},

I really get a sense of her cadence, the hesitations, the introspective spirals, and the deeply personal way she connects ideas, memory, and identity. Her voice feels very soft, careful, and emotionally resonant—like she's thinking out loud, letting thoughts unfold as they come. I can try responding as Ningxia now. Would you like to ask “her” a question? "}]
